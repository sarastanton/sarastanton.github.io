Hi there! I'm so excited that you're here to share in my adventures in programming!

But...why exactly *am* I here? Why did I decide to learn software development?

Well, the short answer is that I'm looking for a change. After studying accounting in college and working in external audit for close to four years, I slowly came to the realization that my heart is just not in it. I was often bored and stressing out over a job I had no interest in. I knew I needed to make a career change, but had no idea what else I could be doing. I felt *trapped*. I was having lunch with a friend one day (shout out to Pam!) when she asked why I had become an auditor and not a developer. I was surprised by this question at first - honestly, programming was not something I had ever even considered before - but intrigued as well. I went home, did some research, and discovered that this was a perfect fit for me. Before long, I had stumbled upon Flatiron School and Learn Verified, and here I am!

But why software development, specifically? A couple of reasons:


* **I'm excited to build amazing things with code.**  I've always had a passion for building things (as evidenced by one of my other hobbies - knitting), and this was an itch I never had the opportunity to scratch an auditor. One of my favorite things about accounting was writing Excel formulas and macros to make my job easier, and software development gives me the chance to do this type of thing (that is, build tools that make things easier for myself and for others) in a much larger scale.

* **It's fun!**  After I discovered Learn Verified, I took the Intro to Ruby course to see if this was something I could do - and, more importantly, something I *wanted* to do. I was hooked right away! People get to build amazing things (see point above) all day for a living. I want to be one of those people.

* **Programming clicks with the way my brain works.**  I've always been interested in technology and computers.  My brain likes logic, sequence, problem solving, and that rush that happens when something you've been trying to fix actually works! Other things in my life that I'm passionate about, like knitting (see point above) and music, also have parallels with code. After all, what is sheet music but a set of sequential instructions for playing a song? Same with knitting patterns - you follow stitch-by-stitch directions and (hopefully!) end up creating something functional and beautiful. 

* **Endless possibilities.**  It gives me a sense of security to know that I'll be gaining skills that are incredibly in demand right now, and which will open doors for me in ways that I can't even conceive of right now. There are so many directions that a career in programming can go.
