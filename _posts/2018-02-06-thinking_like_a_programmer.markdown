Now that I’ve been studying code for a little while, I feel myself starting to think like a programmer. It turns out that the automated things we rely on every day (traffic lights, websites, smoke detectors, etc.) do not just *magically* work, and I have been challenging myself to think about *how* things I interact with every day might work. This ranges from obvious examples that use code (such as websites and mobile apps) to things that are seemingly unrelated to programming in any way. A few examples:

* An automated parking garage sign might use a counter to keep track of how many cars go in and out of the garage in order to determine whether any parking spots are currently available 

* An alarm clock might use an “until” loop (until current time equals 7:00 am, do not ring) or an “if” statement (if the current time equals 7:00 am, ring). 

* Sheet music contains sequential instructions (play F# for 3 beats at medium volume) that a musician can read in the same way a computer might run a program

* Knitting patterns often contain instructions that parallel code, such as “work in established pattern until sleeve measures X inches” or “repeat last row 5 times"

This way of thinking - deliberately and logically, step by step, with explicit sequential instruction and a high degree of precision - is the essence of programming. Writing code is more than syntax and variables; it is a way of thinking through a desired series of actions and explaining them to the computer in a way that is unmistakeable, explicit, precise, and unambiguous. Discovering this has opened my eyes to the world around me, and (hopefully) makes me a better programmer. I can’t wait to put this new insight to use as I build amazing things with code!
