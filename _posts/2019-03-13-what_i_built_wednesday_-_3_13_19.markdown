Hi #codepanions! It’s Wednesday, and you know what that means - it’s time for another What I Built Wednesday! 

Let’s get right down to it - here’s what I’ve been working on this week:

* **Calculator** - Most of my code time this week has gone to my [colorful calculator](https://github.com/sarastanton/colorful-calculator) project. I’ve been having a ton of fun going back to basics (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript) on this project. I have the main calculator styling done and am working on getting the JavaScript logic finished up. The last piece will be the “colorful” part…check back next week to find out more!

* **Bookable w/ React** - It’s still in the very early stages, but I started working on a [version](https://github.com/sarastanton/bookable_w_React) of my Bookable application that uses a React frontend. I am carrying over the same Rails API backend from [my last version](https://github.com/sarastanton/bookable_w_JS) of Bookable - no need to reinvent the wheel here - but I’m still deciding whether or not to include the login/user account and Goodreads OmniAuth features. Check back next week to see what I decided!

* **Upcase** - I also started working my way through some of the lessons on [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase), Thoughtbot’s online learning platform. Upcase has guided lessons on a variety of subjects, from Ruby on Rails to Git, iOS, testing, Vim, and more - and, best of all, is now FREE! Upcase describes itself as a "finishing school”, which sounds like exactly what I need at this in-between stage as bootcamp grad and job seeker. Seriously, if you haven’t checked it out yet, GO DO IT NOW. Go. Do it. I’ll wait. 

* **My network** - Ok, this one might be a bit of a stretch, but I did spend a considerable amount of time building my network this week. Over the past seven days, I attended an open house, a networking mixer, and two coding meetups - phew! My goal is to attend at least one meetup/event per week, and hopefully grow my network to include more contacts in the tech/developer space. 

That’s it for this week - see you again next Wednesday!
