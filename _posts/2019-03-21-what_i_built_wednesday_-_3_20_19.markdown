Another week, another #WhatIBuiltWednesday!

What did I work on this week?

* **My career!** - Similar to [last week](http://codename-sara.com/what_i_built_wednesday_-_3_13_19), this one may or may not qualify for #WhatIBuiltWednesday, but I'm going to include it because I'm incredibly excited about my job search progress! Over the past week I have had 3 phone interviews, 1 take-home code challenge, and 1 pair-programming technical assessment (across two companies). THINGS ARE HAPPENING, FRIENDS. A lot of my code time this week went into the code challenge and into preparing for the technical assessment, but happily I had some time for side projects as well.

* **Calculator** - Colorful Calculator is done! I might make a few tweaks at some point (refactor some [code](https://github.com/sarastanton/colorful-calculator), add a few color themes, a history feature would be neat, etc.), but right now it is functioning as intended and it's ready to go out into the world. Check it out [here](http://sarastanton.github.io/colorful-calculator)!

* **Sinatra Number Guessing Game** - Since I finished a project, I gave myself permission to start [another one](https://github.com/sarastanton/sinatra-number-guess)! I have to restrict myself this way or I will keep starting new projects without finishing them. This will be a simple little project to throw into Sinatra an existing number guessing game I built in Ruby when I was first learning to code (read: *might need some refactoring*). I mainly want to refresh myself on Sinatra and make sure I don't forget how to build Sinatra apps! I might also throw in some JavaScript to render feedback from the game (i.e. whether or not the number has correctly been guessed) without having to refresh the page. I would like to challenge myself to rewrite the game entirely in JavaScript at some point as well.

* **HackerRank** - Partly in preparation for my technical assessment (see above) and partly just to keep my skills sharp, I worked on some practice problems on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) this week. Since I've been working mostly in JavaScript lately, these practice problems have been a great review of the beginner Ruby methods I learned during the waaaaay back early days of the Flatiron School curriculum. If you're looking for a refresher (or even looking to learn Ruby for the first time!), I highly suggest checking out HackerRank. The problems start off easy and progress in difficulty as you go along. 

* **Learn Git Branching** - I recently came across a neat little Git tutorial called [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/), and I worked my way through it this week. Git can sometimes be hard to conceptualize, and this tutorial did a great job of visualizing what happens when you merge, rebase, checkout a branch, etc. I've gotten pretty comfortable with Git at this point in my coding ~journey~ but haven't had much practice using Git collaboratively with others. This is still an individual tutorial, but it provides some practice on Git commands (like the aforementioned merging, rebasing, branching, etc.) that you will likely encounter when working in a code base with others. 

I hope you have a great week! See you next Wednesday for another update. Happy coding!
