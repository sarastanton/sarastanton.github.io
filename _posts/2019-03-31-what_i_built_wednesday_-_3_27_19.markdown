Hi friends! Here's what I worked on this week:
​
* **HackerRank** - I spent some more time working through practice problems on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) this week to dust off my Ruby skills.

​
* **Project Euler** - I have an on-site interview on Monday that I'm VERY excited about, and I know that it will include multiple whiteboarding sessions. Since I have no way of knowing what questions will be asked ahead of time, I can't practice specific problems or topics -- so I wanted to make sure I spent a lot of time practicing general problem-solving with code by working through some Project Euler problems. You can learn more about Project Euler (and find hundreds of problems to work through) [here](https://projecteuler.net/). If you are a Flatiron School student, there is also a Project Euler curriculum track containing 10 problems that have been brought into Learn Verified, with the added bonus of tests included. You can work through the problems using Test-Driven Development, just like any other Learn lab exercise!
​

* **Algorithms** - In a similar vein, I watched a few videos (both on YouTube and on the [Learn Instructional App](https://instruction.learn.co/) video website) walking through strategies for solving technical interview/whiteboard problems.
​

* ***Cracking the Coding Interview***  - I also flipped through the main strategy section (as well as a few practice problems) of the popular *[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)* book.
​
Stay calm and stay coding! I'll be back next week for another #WhatIBuilt Wednesday.
